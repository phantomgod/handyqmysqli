# handyq
Is a program that offers you the possibility to manage your Quality Management System with a single Mysql database, and permits you to:
ADD, EDIT, DELETE, INSERT, UPLOAD, GRAPH AUTOMATICALLY (with Rgraph):
- key indicators
- Non comformities
- System Audits
- Audits informs
- Training-education
- Client satisfaction
- Notes
- External documents (external urls)
- Documents inserted directly in the DB
- Equipment calibrations
- Suppliers
- Incidents
And some more I forgot... (for example, the members sessions with different members area).

To be honest, it is necessary to make some improvements, but it will be the case of future releases-modifications...
Excuse if you find a heap of files and folders... there are some more than necessary, but it do not disturb the running.

For those that are real programmers, I apologize in advance, as they will soon see that I:
- am a cut and paste coder,
- do not almost comment code,
- if I had ever been a sudent, sure i would have been sent down...
And some more I forget...

This is not a program to publish or promote in the Web... It is neccesary that you passw-protect the first-entry-page.
May be the Theme is ungraceful, but I am sure you can change the style.php easily.
This said, it is understood that you will be able to work with this program so in local as online, if you have a hosting account (if you do not, I can provide you one).
Here are some images made years ago:

 and... what can I tell you?
 This progran is working now; is half updated to mysqli, half updated to pdo, half merged with bootstrap framework... may be a disaster, **but works** (Â¿five years more without updates made by myself only?). I have been using with my clients for about ten years.
 
I do not want you to get dizzy for more with my sad explanations, I only want that this software be useful for you, if you are a humble quality management system responsible (of a little-medium) enterprise.

************************************
Use Notepad++ (or other that was able to fin and replace in folders).
Find wherever there is the datas of the connections with the database. The main connection is in the includes folder, but there are some more, for some particular modules in the application.

Change the connection datas with yours (assuming that you have created a Mysql database before). I let you a complete database of example completely false (the datas inside i say). Import this database if you want to begin usin the application with a full sight in the screen (if the tables where empty, would be difficult to begin using the program). If you have some difficulties, i will help (javier@textblock.org).

Thts for today.
